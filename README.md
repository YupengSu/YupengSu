## Hi there 👋

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), advised by Prof. Zheng Zhang. I previously received my B.E. degree in Microelectronics from the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), advised by Prof. Hao Yu.

My research focuses on efficient pre-training and post-training optimization for large language models (LLMs), particularly quantization, sparsification, and low-rank decomposition for improving training and inference efficiency. I am also interested in high-performance computing and AI accelerators, including compiler optimization and GPU/FPGA kernel adaptation for efficient and energy-aware deployment. I have published and submitted papers with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zZ8lS-UAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FYupengSu%2FYupengSu.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top international conferences and journals.

If you are interested in my research or have any questions, also please feel free to contact me at <a href='mailto:yupengsu06@gmail.com'> yupengsu06@gmail.com</a> or <a href='mailto:yupengsu@ucsb.edu.'> yupengsu@ucsb.edu</a>.
